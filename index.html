        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Arjun was in class five. He was always smiling. But there was one thing no one knew he never brought lunch to school. His family didn’t have enough food. So, every day, Arjun drank water and said, “I’m not hungry.” One day, his friend Rishi noticed. He saw Arjun sitting alone during lunch break, watching others eat. Rishi went home and told his mother. The next day, Rishi brought two lunch boxes — one for him, one for Arjun. Arjun was shocked. “Why are you giving me this?” he asked. Rishi smiled and said, “Because you’re my friend.” From then on, Rishi shared his lunch every day. Arjun was thankful, but he didn’t just take help — he also started working hard. He read books from the library. He asked his teacher for extra questions. Slowly, his marks got better. After some time, Arjun came first in his class. On the last day of school, he gave Rishi a small note. It said: “Your food filled my stomach. Your kindness filled my heart. One day, I’ll do the same for someone else.”Years later, Arjun became a doctor. He helped poor children in his town. He gave them food, books, and hope. And in his clinic, he kept a small photo of his school friend — Rishi.
